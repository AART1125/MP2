# MP2
This is a project created by both Neil Harry So and Aaron Ace Toledo

# Specifications
Implement a program that computes for the accelerations of multiple cars in a Y by 3 matrix. Where Y is the number of cars. All inputs are in single floating point.

The output acceleration for each will be converted into integers

Input: Matrix Rows, single float matrix values

Ouput: Integer Acceleration Values (m/s^2)

# Analysis
Average execution times based on number of rows:

10 rows = 0.00000000s
100 rows = 0.00000000s
1000 rows = 0.00000000s
10000 rows = 0.00003333s
